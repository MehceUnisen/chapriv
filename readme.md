 1 - This is a project that me and my friend Omer Yasin Cur are going to bring it alive. Our aim is to make a completely private end to end encrypted "private" chatting space that allows no photo or video sharing at all! (That means no perverts allowed lol)  

 2 - I don't think that this idea is very unique so this repo will be public.

 3 - This project can be represented as a never ending chatting site because we actually discussing about improving the site in the way of user feedbacks, so I'll be living links on the site for feedback, so feel free to reach me out!
